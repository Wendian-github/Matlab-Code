# Matlab Code

These Maltab codes are more biased towards the direction of **Ocean Optic Remote sensing**, but they have the same goal in different ways and have enlightenment in all directions.

Now contain:

1. Some Tips
   1. m_map basic code
   3. some figure setting 
   5. Normal distribution and fitting
2. Density plot *Scatter plot with color indicating data density*
3. **Shallow neural network** example
4. Supporting files **for m_map**
5. Read data files
   2. Read ".nc" file of Modis satellite in batch
6. M map example
   1. Bathymetry
   2. Boundary of provinces and country

**Examples**

1. Bathymetry
